## ISystem Interface
Represents a system.  
Systems are responsible for handling common logic and event dispatch on batches of components.  
To receive callbacks on component creation and destruction, see [IWorldCallbackReceiver](./Lazlo-Gocs-IWorldCallbackReceiver.md 'Lazlo.Gocs.IWorldCallbackReceiver').  
```C#
public interface ISystem
```
